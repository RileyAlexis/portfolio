This allows me to learn and deploy new technologies without being limited by a hosting services' choices.`,

    pickles: [
        `Robotic Pickle Farm is a an iterative, clicker or idle game where players grow cucumbers to make pickles.
                        The eventual goal is to make 2.8 trillion pickles (roughly equal to the global output of planet Earth).
                        Players can use pickles to purchase robots to automate the process and upgrades to make them run faster.
                        I chose to build a game instead of a simple CRUD application to challenge myself to learn the ins and outs
                        of React and Redux. Robotic Pickle Farm must not only read and write data from a Postgres database, but
                        also must parse and run various calculations on that data up to twice per second.`

        `Velvet is an application created early in my education. I was curious about real time audio analysis using javascript and
                        visualizing the audio with HTML canvas. Velvet uses the Web Audio API and Meyda.js to analyze the spectral centroid, also
                        known as resonance or brightness, of a human voice.`,
        `The intent of this application is to demonstrate a possible tool for speech
                        therapy that could be run entirely on the user's system. The application does not have a backend server, does not
                        save or transmit any data and doesn't even require an internet connection once downloaded. Velvet is designed with user privacy
                        and security in mind given the nature of the application.`
