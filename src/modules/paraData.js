    pickles: [
        `Robotic Pickle Farm is a an iterative, clicker or idle game where players grow cucumbers to make pickles.
                        The eventual goal is to make 2.8 trillion pickles (roughly equal to the global output of planet Earth).
                        Players can use pickles to purchase robots to automate the process and upgrades to make them run faster.
                        I chose to build a game instead of a simple CRUD application to challenge myself to learn the ins and outs
                        of React and Redux. Robotic Pickle Farm must not only read and write data from a Postgres database, but
                        also must parse and run various calculations on that data up to twice per second.`

        `Velvet is a real time speech analysis tool. Velvet grew out of a need for a more
        accurate, free and open source voice analysis application that could also be trustworthy. 
        This application is free and always will be. It collects no data and does not communicate with any
        other services.
        
        Velvet identifies the fundamental frequency and the first formant frequency of an audio signal and
        displays it in real time. It can create a stream from the device microphone or from an upoaded
        audio file.
